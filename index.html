        <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
        Players assume roles within a tribe—King, Witch Doctor, and Tribe Members. The King creates rules that test the Tribe Members' fate, while the Witch Doctor holds the power to influence life and death. Through a series of trials, votes, conspiracies, and duels, players seek to navigate the hierarchy. Victory is achieved by amassing 7 points through various outcomes: the King's successful reign, the Witch Doctor's dominance, or the Tribe Members' overthrow.

    <section>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<h4>Establishment of King and Witch Doctor:</h4> Each player is dealt one card face down. The player with the highest card becomes the King, and the player left of the King becomes the Witch Doctor.  </p>

<h4>Dealing of Cards:</h4> Cards are shuffled and deck is split, King gets half of the deck and the Witch Doctor gets the other half. The King deals a card face down to each player, including themselves. The Witch Doctor deals “Spirit Cards” face down and horizontal to all players, including themselves.  </p>

<h4>Placing Cards:</h4> All players place their cards dealt by the king outward on their foreheads without looking at them.  </p>

<h4>King's Rule:</h4> The King creates a rule based on the color and/or value of the cards. (See "Gameplay" for details)  </p>

<h4>Game Begins:</h4> Players follow the King's rule.  </p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<h4>King's Rule Creation:</h4>  </p>
    - The King creates a rule based on the color and/or value of the cards.  </p>
    - Formula: The rule consists of one or more conditional statements. For example, "If the card is red and higher than mine, put your card down."  </p>
    - Example: "If the card is red and higher than mine, put your card down. If you are right, you die."  </p>
<h4>Player Actions:</h4> Players take action (keep card up or put down), confirming with a thumbs up. </p> 

<h4>Consequences:</h4> Players reveal their cards and determine whether they are dead or alive. Can use VATS-RuleAnalyzer to confirm.  </p>

<h4>Voting:</h4> Living tribe members vote to keep or kill the King. Majority vote wins OR results in duel.  </p>

<h4>Dueling Mechanism:</h4> If there's a tie in the voting, players engage in duels. The higher card wins (or sum of card values wins for 2V2 or greater) the loser/s are considered dead. If the duel is a 1V1 and the party that wants to kill the king wins, the King has one last chance to defend himself by creating a rule that concludes in either his death or the challenger’s. </p> 

<h4>Witch Doctor's Rule:</h4> Once the King's fate is determined, the Witch Doctor creates a rule for the players who died based on the color of their Spirit Card. This rule typically rhymes and dictates whether the player stays dead or is brought back to life. For example, "If the spirit card is red, you are still dead; if it is black, you are back."  </p>
<h4>Witch Doctor's Special Rules:</h4> If the Witch Doctor dies in the King's rule phase, they have the option to still set rules beyond the grave, and everyone who is dead turns their spirit card. Those who are alive can then vote to sacrifice the king or keep him alive. 
        If the Witch Doctor is the only one to survive the King's rule, then they can choose not to give a rule to raise the dead. and challenge the King to the death. If they lose then the Lone/sad King survives and gets 1 point. If he wins he becomes ruler of the underworld and is awarded 4 points. </p>
         
<h4>The round is concluded.</h4>  </p>

<h4>New Round:</h4> If the King is kept alive, roles are kept. If the King is killed, a new King is elected through the highest card among the living tribe members and a new Witch Doctor is established to the left of the King (Witch Doctor can be alive or dead). Deck is reshuffled and split.  </p> 

    
<h3>Victory Conditions</h3>
<h4>Real Legend Victory:</h4> The tribe member wins through the dueling mechanism 1V1 and becomes the Peasant, the King, and the Witch Doctor all in one. 3 pts awarded  </p>

<h4>King's Victory:</h4> The King keeps all players alive until the end of the round. 3 pts awarded  </p>

<h4>Witch Doctor's Victory:</h4> All other players are dead, whether or not the Witch Doctor is alive. 2 pts awarded   </p>

<h4>Lonely King Victory (The Plague):</h4> The King survives alone and the failed challenger faces consequences. -1 pts to King, -2 pts to the challenger  </p>

<h3>Winning the Game</h3>
The first player to reach 7 points wins the game.
