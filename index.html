Game Manual
            
Setup            
Establishment of King and Witch Doctor: Each player is dealt one card face down. The player with the highest card becomes the King, and the player left of the King becomes the Witch Doctor.
Dealing of Cards: Cards are shuffled and deck is split, King gets half of the deck and the Witch Doctor gets the other half. The King deals a card face down to each player, including themselves. The Witch Doctor deals “Spirit Cards” face down and horizontal to all players, including themselves.
            
Placing Cards: All players place their cards dealt by the king outward on their foreheads without looking at them.
            
King's Rule: The King creates a rule based on the color and/or value of the cards. (See "Gameplay" for details)
            
Game Begins: Players follow the King's rule.
            
Gameplay            
King's Rule Creation:
The King creates a rule based on the color and/or value of the cards.
     - Formula: The rule consists of one or more conditional statements. For example, "If the card is red and higher than mine, put your card down."
     - Example: "If the card is red and higher than mine, put your card down. If you are right, you die."
            
Player Actions: Players take action (keep card up or put down), confirming with a thumbs up.
            
Consequences: Players reveal their cards and determine whether they are dead or alive. Can use VATS-RuleAnalyzer to confirm.
            
Voting: Living tribe members vote to keep or kill the King. Majority vote wins OR results in duel.
            
Dueling Mechanism: If there's a tie in the voting, players engage in duels. The higher card wins (or sum of card values wins for 2V2 or greater) the loser/s are considered dead. If the duel is a 1V1 and the party that wants to kill the king wins, the King has one last chance to defend himself by creating a rule that concludes in either his death or the challenger’s.
Witch Doctor's Rule: Once the King's fate is determined, the Witch Doctor creates a rule for the players who died based on the color of their Spirit Card. This rule typically rhymes and dictates whether the player stays dead or is brought back to life. For example, "If the spirit card is red, you are still dead; if it is black, you are back."
The round is concluded.
            
New Round: Deck is reshuffled and split. If the King is kept alive, roles are kept. If the King is killed, a new King is elected through the highest card among the living tribe members and a new Witch Doctor is established (Witch Doctor can be alive or dead).
